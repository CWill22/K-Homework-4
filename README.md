This program is a management system of showroom vehicles. It is an Object-Oriented program based in Java. The purpose of this program is to hold different types of vehicle objects and be able to get various bits of information out of them. The main class Vehicle contains all of the information that is used to classify each adn every vehicle that gets added to the manager. We then made subclasses for different types of vehicles like trucks, cars, SUVs, and motorbikes. This allows the user to further search for a specified vehicle. The last portion of this program has a number of different methods that allows you to get more abstract data about a vehicle such as which vehicle has the highest fuel efficiency or the vehicle with the lowest maintenance cost.

The workload was split in the follwoing manner. Ethan was in charge of creating the Vehicle class with its attributes and methods. Alasdair created the subclasses along with the constructors, copy constructors, and getters/setter methods for each class. Braeden was in charge of defining all of the enums and ensuring they worked with each class. Will was in charge of the Singleton Class and reading/saving from the CSV file. The whole team focused on the final methods that wrapped up the rest of the project.
